# Monster GIF Mash

### Search for Monstrous GIFs!
Users can search for monster related GIFs from a predefined list of monsters, or they can create monster searches of their own!

### Requirements
In order to search for GIFs, users simply need to have an internet connection and navigate to https://jsills3110.github.io/MonsterGifs/.

### Features

##### Add Your Own Monster Searches
Users can create custom searches by typing in a topic and selecting 'Add GIF Button'. They can then click on that button and GIFs related 
to their topic will appear.

##### Favorites
Each GIF appears with a star button, which can be clicked. This will add the GIF to the user's favorites list, which will persist even after
the user closes their browser window.

### Contributing

This project was meant to be an exercise in APIs for my coding bootcamp. While you are more than welcome to fork the 
repository and modify the game for yourself, I will likely not accept pull requests. However, if you choose to review the
code and you have questions or comments for me, I am more than happy to hear them! In fact, I'd love to receive feedback on 
my code. Please feel free to email me at the address listed on my Github account.
